# Qonsole
## A simple console emulator
This is a very simple console emulator. You can issue commands based on the methods available in the model.
There are two example commands in the model, and you can create as many as you like. Check out `App\Models\Qonsole` to see the example commands.

The app uses Laravel in the back and Vue in the front.

To get this project up 'n' running just download it and start serving it.

Also check out `resources\js\vue` to change how the app is shown.
